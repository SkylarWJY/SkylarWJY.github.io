Project Summary: I created machine learning models for the home insurance comparison search engine to predict customer purchasing probability,delivered customer insights to sales department with 8% increase in operational efficiency [Random Forest, XGBoost, H2O]
<br>
Importance: For the slowed conversion rate: Creating a classifier model to predict user purchasing probability can enable salespeople prioritize and focus on users with a high purchasing rate to increase revenue

Project Summary: I developed the Probability of Default model for investors of a P2P lending company to assess counterparties’ credit rating; Implemented logistic regression to build a Personal Lending model mapping the default probability to an ordinal rating system as a predictor for loan interest rate [Python];Confirmed model robustness and generalizability through backtesting, benchmarking against alternative models, sensitivity tests, and model assumptions testing [Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-fold Cross-validation]

Project Summary: Recommender systems are well-studied and proven to provide tremendous values to internet businesses and their consumers; I implemented ALS matrix factorization on 100,000 ratings to provide personalized movies recommendations and developed user-based approaches to handle system cold-start problem with RMSE 0.69; Tuned hyperparameters via Spark ML cross-evaluation toolbox and monitored data processing performance via Spark UI on AWS

**Application: make recommendations to users with given userIds**

### Bank Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

[![Run in Google Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Colab-Run_in_Google_Colab-blue?logo=Google&logoColor=FDBA18)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_k66ypxF1X8Cffjjt5Y-iZCsz9T70GCs#scrollTo=Jy5hU5KymPT7)

Project Summary: I developed supervised learning models to identify customer churn probability and analyze top factors that influence user retention; Preprocessed data for downstream statistical analysis through imputation of missing values, outlier detection, and categorical
feature transformation; Trained Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest and XGboost via K-fold Cross-validation; Applied regularization with optimal hyperparameter to overcome overfitting and evaluated model performance via F1 score 0.86

[![Open Research Poster](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Open_Research_Poster-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)](pdf/Food.pdf)

Project Summary: This food search engine is designed to support individual users to explore detailed behind-scene facts of certain food products that match their criteria; Established full-text search functionality with Elasticsearch in combination with MongoDB to query unstructured data sources; Created a Flask front-end interface to form an API connection with backend data-sources as an interactive, web-based point of contact for search queries
